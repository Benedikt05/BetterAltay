 * Called when a player connects to the server, prior to authentication taking place.

 * This event should be used to decide if the player may continue to login to the server. Do things like checking
 * bans, whitelisting, server-full etc here.

 * WARNING: Any information about the player CANNOT be trusted at this stage, because they are not authenticated and
 * could be a hacker posing as another player.
 *
 * WARNING: Due to internal bad architecture, the player is not fully constructed at this stage, and errors might occur
 * when calling API methods on the player. Tread with caution.
