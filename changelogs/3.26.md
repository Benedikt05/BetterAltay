**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.0**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.26.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.0.
- Removed compatibility with earlier versions.

# 3.26.1
- Fixed a bug in chunk sending that caused double chests to not be paired, signs to be blank, and various other issues.

 # 3.26.2
- Improved error messages shown by `start.cmd`, `start.sh` and `start.ps1` when the PHP binary was not found.- The value of PHPRC is now shown when erroring out due to unsatisfied PHP requirements.
- Removed restriction on the range of valid channels for `auto-updater.channel` in `pocketmine.yml`.

# 3.26.3
- `PlayerExperienceChangeEvent->setNewProgress()` now performs range checks. This fixes the root of a very old and confusing crash bug which took several years to identify the cause of.
  - Note that the defective plugin(s) which caused this problem will still cause a server crash, but the plugin responsible will now get blamed correctly.

# 3.26.4
- Fixed chunks containing furnaces in old worlds (pre-2017) being discarded as corrupted.
  - This was caused by a strict corruption check detecting bad data created by a bug in PocketMine-MP that was fixed in 2017.
